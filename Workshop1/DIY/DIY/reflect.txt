In this workshop, i learnt about the comma seperated files and how to get it executed in the perfect manner.
For the part one, as the codes were already given, so the task was so simple. The task given in the LAB part 
was just to divide the code into the files and submit. However, the most difficult part for me came was the DIY 
part. In this part there were total 8 files to be created. Unfortunately, i had faced issues in my DIY part in the UI.cpp
file which read the data of the file of student.csv. 
-- if (fileopen("students.csv")) --> the corrected code
In that i had made a mistake of a bracket and due to that i was not getting 
the code complied and as the file was not being read, so it didn't gave me the output as it was needed.
And at the end i figured out the i had forgot to keep the last closing bracket for the if condition. The another problem is faced 
in the DIY was how to code further after,

  Enter GPA query...
  ? @2.2
  Syntax error: ? [Op][value]<ENTER>
  Op: [>,<,~,!]
  value: GPA value

gets executed. Then to further get the code executed i had taken the 
     int outp(const char character, const double score, const struct GPA* STUD)
function and in that at first took the for loop and and in that i had taken the if, else if and else conditions to get code execution done.
