In the milestone project, it was fun in learning on how to build an app as well as some difficulties that were faced im doing the tasks. The milestone was divided into mainly five parts. Later, the last fifth part was divided into five more parts. In this milestone 5 version 4 namely MS5-4, in this version we were told to have a method called stockItem in which when the user selects the items using the number like integer. This selection will prompt the list of the item or the name and details of the item and later the user will have to enter the quantity he needs which is also a integer and when the item  stock up is done it will exit the app.
