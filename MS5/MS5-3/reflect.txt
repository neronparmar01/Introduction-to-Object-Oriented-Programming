In the milestone project, it was fun in learning on how to build an app as well as some difficulties that were faced im doing the tasks. The milestone was divided into mainly five parts. Later, the last fifth part was divided into five more parts. In this milestone 5 version 3 namely MS5-3, we were supposed to do the app in such a way that it can select the item and this implemetation should be done using name selectItem. In this we had a method named selectItem and it would allow the user to select the items and enter the row number. Basically, it would take the number associated to the item and get it to the list. Moreover, the another thing we had to do was add the removeItem method in which again the item could be removed by entering a specific number.
