In the milestone project, it was fun in learning on how to build an app as well as some difficulties that were faced im doing the tasks. The milestone was divided into mainly five parts. Later, the last fifth part was divided into five more parts. In this milestone 5 version 5 namely MS5-5, in this version the file of csv was upadated named postdataOrigin.csv. In this version we had to print the bill in which the user selected item was listed. However, it worked when SKU was found and if SKU not found then the bill would be printed with final entries.
