In the workshop 2, there were two parts, the first one was the lab part and the another one was the DIY. For the Lab part i found it difficult as 
i got many errors in it while working on it. However, for the DIY part was quiet friendly and had less errors foung while debbuging as we just had to 
get the output of the data after loading the data completly. Yet, for the Lab part the issue i faced was with the initial stage of coding. The problem
i had was in file named Package.cpp. In this file everything went well as the things got with flow, but the error that was faced by me was at the starting
of the file in the function named as int loadTraces(). In this function we were given that task to complete the remaining part of the file by following 
the instructions. Although, in this the issues was that the allocation of the memory of the for the arrrays of the customers was to be done dynamically. 
At first the datafile in which the datas were given was initiated into the Package.cpp file with the condition of if saying --> if (openFile_r(filename_r)).
Later one the the number of the traces were also set, but when it came to the array i made a mistake that it wasn't set to the initial and due to that it had
issues in giving the output. The error i made was;
      char Package_Name[];
     	 users = (Customers*)malloc(sizeof(Customers) * no_of_traces);
However, later on i found out that it was saying to set the value so i had set the value at the initial as well as given the array size of 30.
        char Package_Name[30] = "";
	  users = (Customers*)malloc(sizeof(Customers) * no_of_traces);

After getting the Lab part done. The next thing was to do was the DIY part. In this it was not that tough but the main thing that i faced problem in was the displaying
of the output. In this, the vital thing that confused me was giving output of many attributes in the single output.
		void display(const CustomersRecord& t_rec) {		 
		for (int i = 0;i < t_rec.noOfRecords;i++) {
			cout << i + 1 << "," << t_rec.ptr_rec[i].user_name << "," << t_rec.ptr_rec[i].likes_count << "," << t_rec.ptr_rec[i].retweets_count << "," << t_rec.ptr_rec[i].replies_count << "," << t_rec.ptr_rec[i].share_videos << endl;
		}
