In this workshop 4, I have learnt about constructing an object and as well as destroying it. In the LAB part I was said to create the module of soccer
that is basically the Soccer.cpp and its header file. Later on the other modules that i was asked to create were SoccerTeam.cpp as well as its SoccerTeam.h,
following to it the last module was the Tournament.cpp and its header file Tournament.h and with it the it contained the main.cpp file of program. However, coming 
to the main part of the workshop that was about creating the DIY program. The DIY part contained three files that were NameTag.cpp, NameTag.h and the main.cpp file.
As the main.cpp file was already given to me, I had to create the two files that were NameTag.cpp and NameTag.h. At first, I had created the header file in that i 
had made a class and given its name as NameTag, it contains two attributes named as m_name and m_extension with the datatypes as charater and integer. Later, created
functions as the constructor called NameTag(); then two constructors with the arguments one had its name without the extension number and other with extension number, 
also the destructor to not let the memory get leaked. Apart from these function the other function was void print() const; that would print the nametags. Lastly, the 
read function to make the nametag inputed and get read by the code. However, I had tried to initially make the name nullptr this time. So, from this workshop i can say
that i have learnt a good lesson for using the constructor and destructor as well creating them and also initially making the attribute's value nullptr or zero.
